# Stock market options calcultors

The scripts in this repository were designed to help analyze various option techniques that can be used in the stock market

This analysis includes allowing risk tolerance adjustment, potential profit vs possible losses, breakeven points, and much more. Information is shown via dataframe tables as well as visually with plots. 

The goal of these projects are to be able to make more educated decisions in a quicker timeframe. Rather than calculating things out paper and pencil, I decided to automate the process.
